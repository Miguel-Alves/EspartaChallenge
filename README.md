# ESPARTA CHALLENGE
This repository was created to mantain my solutions and my participation on the challenges proposed by Esparta.

## Organization
So, the challenge consisted on 3 differente parts. The first one was made to verify logic, the second one to teste SQL and Databases knowledges and the third one to test React Native.

This repository is organized following these structure.
